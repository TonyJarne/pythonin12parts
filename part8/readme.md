# Part 8: Combining files

This folder contains slides and notebooks relating to combining files and dataframes in Python, using `os` and `pandas`, plus a little more on `requests`

* The [slides on `request` and `os`](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part8/07_Requests_os.pdf) explain how these work in fetching files, and navigating the remote file system in order to combine CSV files
* A [notebook shows those libraries in action](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part8/10osRequests.ipynb) - you can adapt the code to your own situation
* The [slides on the `merge` function and `append`](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part8/08_mergePython.pdf) explain how those can be used to combine `pandas` dataframes in different ways
* A [notebook shows those being used ](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part8/11mergePandas.ipynb)to grab context on FOI request refusals, and to combine data on FOI refusals from different periods

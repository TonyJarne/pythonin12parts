            "It follows a virtual meeting last week with Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova, and Attorney General Suella Braverman to discuss what help the country needs to collect and preserve evidence of war crimes.\n",
            "This is the latest in a series of efforts to provide Ukraine with economic, diplomatic, humanitarian and defensive support alongside lethal aid. The UK Government is also investigating how to stop Russian oligarchs using the British legal system to intimidate and silence their critics.\n",

            "Tomorrow I will go to The Hague to offer the ICC UK technical support in bringing those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to justice – including support with the immediate priority of gathering and preserving evidence.\n",
            "Russian commanders carrying out war crimes should know they cannot act with impunity. Like Radovan Karadzic and Charles Taylor before them, their actions risk landing them in a jail cell.\n",
            "Separately, Dominic Raab will meet ambassadors from a range of countries to build a coalition able to provide extra assistance and cooperation to the Office of the Prosecutor to investigate war crimes in Ukraine.\n",
            "The UK has a long history of supporting war crimes prosecutions from Nuremburg through to the Yugoslav tribunals in the 1990s and was a founder member of the ICC.\n",
            "The offer ranges from police and military analysis to specialist IT to help the ICC collect and preserve evidence, as well as the UK’s significant legal expertise. It might eventually lead to witness relocation and imprisoning those found guilty, as the UK has done for previous war crimes.\n",
            "Separately, last week the Attorney General, Suella Braverman, signed a statement with the Ukraine’s Prosecutor General which reaffirms the UK’s support for holding Russia to account for war crimes committed in Ukraine.\n",
            "The Deputy Prime Minister was the FCDO’s head of war crimes in the British Embassy in the Hague, liaising with the ICC from 2003 until 2006, supporting the prosecution of war crimes. In this role he negotiated agreements that have since allowed for witnesses to be relocated to safety in the UK and for those convicted to serve their sentences in UK prisons, including Radovan Karadžić who was found convicted of genocide in Bosnia at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 2016.\n",
            "He is leading a taskforce of Ministers, senior civil servants and operational partners such as the police and Crown Prosecution Service to establish how best the UK can support the ICC prosecute war crimes in Ukraine.\n",

            "New measures targeted directly at keeping women and girls safer will be added to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill today (4 January) the Government has announced.\n",
            "Under the changes, victims of domestic abuse will be allowed more time to report incidents of common assault or battery against them. Currently, prosecutions must commence within six months of the offence.\n",
            "Instead, this requirement will be moved to six months from the date the incident is formally reported to the police – with an overall time limit of two years from the offence to bring a prosecution. Domestic abuse is often reported late relative to other crimes; so this will ensure victims have enough time to seek justice and that perpetrators answer for their actions.\n",
            "Meanwhile, taking non-consensual photographs or video recordings of breastfeeding mothers will be made a specific offence punishable by up to two years in prison. It covers situations where the motive is to obtain sexual gratification, or to cause humiliation, distress or alarm. Similar legislation introduced by the Government in 2019 that criminalised “upskirting” has led to more than 30 prosecutions since it became law.\n",
            "Ministers are changing the law to protect mums from being harassed no matter where they choose to breastfeed.\n",
            "Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab said:\n",
            "We are committed to doing everything we can to protect women, make them feel safer, and give them greater confidence in the justice system.\n",
            "We’re giving the victims of domestic abuse longer to report the offence to the police – so abusers don’t evade justice. And we will introduce a new offence to stop people filming or taking photos of mothers breast feeding without their consent – because no new mum should be harassed in this way.\n",
            "Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs said:\n",
            "I strongly welcome the additions made to the PCSC Bill today, which allow victims of domestic abuse more time to report to the police.\n",
            "It is important that all domestic abuse victims have the time and opportunity to report to the police. This is especially important following Covid restrictions, when many victims faced additional challenges to seeking help and reporting domestic abuse.\n",
            "I want to see increased prosecutions for domestic abuse, and hope to see that as these measures remove another barrier to bringing perpetrators to justice.\n",
            "In making photographing breastfeeding mothers without consent a specific offence, the Government is giving police and prosecutors the clarity and powers they need to ensure perpetrators face justice.\n",
            "Today’s announcement builds on measures already in the Bill to better protect women such as ending the halfway release of offenders sentenced between four and seven years in prison for serious sexual offences – forcing them to spend two-thirds of their time in prison.\n",
            "In December, the legislation was amended to make clear that a new legal duty requiring public bodies to work together to tackle serious violence can also include domestic abuse and sexual offences.  It means that these crimes should be taken as seriously as knife crime and homicide, with police, government, and health bodies required to collaborate locally, so that they can develop more holistic strategies to protect people from harm, including through early intervention.\n",
            "Home Secretary, Priti Patel, said:\n",
            "My commitment to making our homes, streets and communities safer for women and girls is clear. Every department  in government is working to address and tackle all issues relating to violence against women and girls. The Government has a focussed Strategy, dedicated to providing essential support for survivors, the prevention of crimes against women and girls and bringing perpetrators to justice with the full force of the law.\n",
            "Our actions include the new Domestic Abuse Act, with important changes to our laws; a newly created  national police lead responsible solely on violence against women and girls, and millions of pounds have been invested in direct safety measures through the Safer Streets Fund. These are all important public confidence measures and changes to ensure the safety of women and girls in public spaces.\n",
            "But this Government is determined to do more, and the amendments being introduced to this Bill today put victims’ voices at the heart of our decisions – giving domestic abuse victims more time to make a report to the police, and providing better protections to mothers breast feeding their children.\n",
            "The amendments will be made to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts and debated by Parliament.\n",

            "As my Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minster has set out, over the last 3 weeks, through a shared effort right across government and our armed forces, we have delivered the largest and most complex evacuation in living memory.\n",
            "Between 15 and 29 August, the UK evacuated over 15,000 people from Afghanistan. That includes: over 8,000 British nationals, close to 5,000 Afghans who loyally served the UK, along with their dependents, and around 500 special cases of particularly vulnerable Afghans, including Chevening scholars, journalists, human rights defenders, campaigners for women’s rights, judges and many others.\n",
            "Of course, the work to get people out did not start on 15 August. The FCDO advised British nationals to leave the country in April, and then again on 6 August. We estimate that around 500 did so.\n",
            "At the same time, the government launched the ARAP scheme for interpreters and other Afghan staff, getting over 1,900 out before the airlift began on 15 August.\n",
            "Now as the security situation deteriorated, we accelerated that process throughout July and early August. \n",
            "In total since April, we have helped over 17,000 people leave.\n",
            "And I want to place on record my thanks, and pay tribute to the Herculean efforts of our troops, our diplomats, our civil servants who have done an incredible job in the toughest of conditions. And as we remember their efforts we also remember those of UK armed forces who paid the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan trying to make that country a better place for the Afghan people.\n",
            "Mr Speaker, now that the evacuation has ended, we have moved into a new phase. We stand by our commitment to support those who have worked for us, and to take all remaining eligible cases. Securing their safe passage out of the country is an immediate priority. We are working through our diplomatic channels to that end.\n",
            "And of course the Taliban have given assurances that they will provide safe passage for foreign nationals and those eligible Afghans who wish to leave. On 30 August the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2593. Driven by the UK alongside the US and France, affirming the international community’s expectation requirement that the Taliban should follow through on the assurances that they have given.\n",
            "Last, week I visited Qatar and Pakistan. In Qatar, I met with the Emir and the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed, to discuss safe passage alongside the international community’s wider approach to dealing with the Taliban. We discussed ongoing efforts to re-establish flights at Kabul airport, where Qatari technical staff are working on the ground, and see how we can cooperate in handling the organisation of future flights.\n",
            "I also announced our new non-resident Chargé d’Affaires for Afghanistan, Martin Longden, who is now working out of Doha.\n",
            "In Pakistan, I met with Prime Minister Khan and Foreign Minister Qureshi to discuss safe passage via third countries, and the importance of holding the Taliban to its commitments.\n",
            "I also announced that we are sending £30 million of support to Afghanistan’s neighbours. This will provide life-saving support for refugees including shelters, household necessities, sanitation and other hygiene facilities.\n",
            "At the same time I dispatched last week a new Rapid Deployment Team to the region, with an extra 22 staff in total. They will reinforce our embassy teams, our high commission teams in those neighbouring countries, processing British nationals or eligible Afghans who are seeking to leave via third countries, which we want to do just as fast as we possibly can, once they can leave, and subject to the necessary security checks.\n",
            "I also spoke to the foreign minister of Uzbekistan earlier today, and the foreign minister of Tajikistan last week. And the Minister for South Asia, Lord Ahmad, last week visited Tajikistan and will return to the region shortly.\n",
            "Mr Speaker turning to the wider international strategy. The international community is adjusting and it must adjust to the new reality in Afghanistan and recalibrate its approach. The UK is playing a leading role.\n",
            "My Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister convened G7 leaders on 24 August to discuss a shared response to the situation. That followed a G7 Foreign Ministers meeting.\n",
            "And we are building a global coalition around four key priorities set out in a UK G7 paper that we have shared with those partners:\n",
            "First, we must prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a safe haven or harbour for terrorists ever again.\n",
            "Second, we must prevent a humanitarian disaster and support refugees – wherever possible in the region. The UK has allocated £286 million in aid for Afghanistan this year. We are supporting Afghanistan’s neighbours, as I have already set out, and the Home Secretary has set out our resettlement scheme. We are leading by example, which enables us to encourage others to step up in what will inevitably have to be an international team effort.\n",
            "Third, we must preserve regional stability, which risks being shattered by the combination of renewed terrorist threat and an exodus of refugees.\n",
            "Fourth, we must hold the Taliban and other factions to account for their conduct, including in particular on human rights and their treatment of women and girls.\n",
            "I am taking this forward through our bilateral partners and we have a G7-plus meeting later this week.\n",
            "The UK is also pressing for further discussions amongst the Permanent Members of the UN Security Council, and we plan to host an event at the UN General Assembly later this month as indicated by the Prime Minister.\n",
            "Mr Speaker, we will not recognise the Taliban, but we will engage, and we will carefully calibrate our actions to the choices that they make and the actions that they take.\n",
            "Given our strategic priorities, the ones that I’ve set out, we must also set some credible tests to hold the Taliban to the undertakings they have made on safe passage, on terrorism, on humanitarian access, and a more inclusive government. And we stand ready to use all the levers at our disposal in that effort - political, economic and diplomatic.\n",
            "Mr Speaker, we continue to galvanise the international community, and bring together the widest possible group of influential countries, to deliver on those strategic priorities and exercise the maximum moderating influence on the Taliban that we possibly can.\n",
            "I commend this statement to the House.\n"

# Part 6: String cleaning (including dealing with dates)

This folder contains notebooks that show how to work with strings (text) and dates in Python.

* The [first notebook](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part6/CheckTextInPage.ipynb) works through how to use Python to tell if a webpage contains a word (string) or not. As it involves large chunks of printed text, it's best downloaded first and then uploaded to Google Drive and opened there as a working Colab notebook.
* A [second notebook](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part6/08CSurgery2dates.ipynb) provides a case study in dealing with a dates, which also includes a scraper that grabs the data we need to clean.

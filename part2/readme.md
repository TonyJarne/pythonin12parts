# 2: Lists, dictionaries, functions and libraries

This folder contains notebooks related to lists, dictionaries, functions and libraries.

* The [first notebook](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part2/03listsDictsFunctions.ipynb) explains what lists, dictionaries and functions are in Python, how to recognise them - and why you might need them. 
* The [second notebook](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part2/04libraries.ipynb) introduces **libraries** (collections of functions), why you might need one, how to use one, and how to access the functions from them.

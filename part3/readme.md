This folder contains notebooks related to using the `pandas` library in Python for data importing/exporting and analysis.

* The [second notebook](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonin12parts/blob/main/part3/06pandasExample.ipynb) walks through an example of using those techniques to import data from a sheet in an an Excel workbook, clean up and sort that data, and perform some basic analysis to put that data into context, before exporting the results
